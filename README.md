## Specifications 
- [x] When a user submits the email composition form, add JavaScript code to actually send the email.
    - [x] Once the email has been sent, load the user‚Äôs sent mailbox.
- [x] When a user visits their Inbox, Sent mailbox, or Archive, load the appropriate mailbox. When a mailbox is visited, the application should first query the API for the latest emails in that mailbox. 
    - [x] Each email should then be rendered in its own box (e.g. a div with a border) that displays who the email is from, what the subject line is, and the timestamp of the email.
    - [x] If the email is unread, it should appear with a white background. If the email has been read, it should appear with a gray background.
- [x] When a user clicks on an email, the user should be taken to a view where they see the content of that email.
    - [x] Your application should show the email‚Äôs sender, recipients, subject, timestamp, and body.
    - [x] Once the email has been clicked on, you should mark the email as read. Recall that you can send a PUT request to /emails/email_id to update whether an email is read or not.
- [x] Allow users to archive and unarchive emails that they have received.
    - [x] When viewing an Inbox email, the user should be presented with a button that lets them archive the email. When viewing an Archive email, the user should be presented with a button that lets them unarchive the email. This requirement does not apply to emails in the Sent mailbox.
    - [x] Once an email has been archived or unarchived, load the user‚Äôs inbox.
- [x] Allow users to reply to an email. When viewing an email, the user should be presented with a ‚ÄúReply‚Äù button that lets them reply to the email.
    - [x] When the user clicks the ‚ÄúReply‚Äù button, they should be taken to the email composition form.
    - [x] Pre-fill the composition form with the recipient field set to whoever sent the original email. Pre-fill the subject line. Pre-fill the body of the email with the original text of the email.
